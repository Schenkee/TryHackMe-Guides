## üõ†Ô∏è TASK 1: Capture Flag1 at /etc/flag1
Navigate to the first task at **http://MACHINE_IP/challenges/chall1.php** Once the page loads we are greeted with a important message to aid us in capturing the flag.  
The page reads "The Input form is broken! You need to send **'POST'** request with **'file'** parameter! This message gives us a great starting point as we know we need to send a POST request. This can be done in a couple of different manners such as BurpSuite or Curl.

In this instance I will use Curl to generate the POST request and recive the flag. Open up your terminal either on your VM or in the AttackBox using CTRL+ALT+T and input the below command 

```curl http://MACHINE_IP/challenges/chall1.php -X POST -d "file=../../../../etc/flag1" ```  
-X is used with curl to change the request method from the default of GET to something else such as POST in this case  
-d is used to set the data to send with the POST request in this case file=../../../../etc/flag1
You should end up with something like the below
./File_Inclusion/Images/lab1_curl.png

This will then return a raw response from the web server whhich will contain our flag as below.
