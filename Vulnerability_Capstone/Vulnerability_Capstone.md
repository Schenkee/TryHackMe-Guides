## 🧩 Challenge Task Overview

**Objective:**   
This guide will cover the steps required to gain the answer to all question in the Vulnerability Capstone room which concludes the Vulnerability Research module. There are many different exploits out there that can be used to exploit this vulnerability. But I found the one included below useful as it included a webshell and also a reverse shell. You can of course use only a webshell and then use this to load in a reverse shell.

## 🧰 Tools I Used  
- ExploitDB 
- Searchsploit  
- FuelCMS webshell + netcat reverse shell by ac1d/AssassinUKG found here: [https://github.com/AssassinUKG/fuleCMS](https://github.com/AssassinUKG/fuleCMS)

Firstly lets start our target machine and give it a few minutes to start all relevant services. We can also either start the AttackBox or as in my case connect our own machine to the TryHackMe VPN.

## 🛠️ TASK 1: Name of the application running on the machine?
