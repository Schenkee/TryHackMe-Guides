## üß© Challenge Task Overview

**Objective:**   
This guide will cover the steps required to gain the answer to all question in the Vulnerability Capstone room which concludes the Vulnerability Research module. There are many different exploits out there that can be used to exploit this vulnerability. But I found the one included below useful as it included a webshell and also a reverse shell. You can of course use only a webshell and then use this to load in a reverse shell.

## üß∞ Tools I Used  
- [Exploit-DB](https://www.exploit-db.com/)
- Searchsploit  
- FuelCMS webshell + netcat reverse shell by ac1d/AssassinUKG found here: [https://github.com/AssassinUKG/fuleCMS](https://github.com/AssassinUKG/fuleCMS)

Firstly lets start our target machine and give it a few minutes to start all relevant services. It is recommanded to use the TryHackME AttackBox for this room, but I had no problems completing the room from my own VM via the VPN.

## üõ†Ô∏è TASK 1: Name of the application and version number running on the machine?   
Once the machine has loaded we can navigate to the machine IP in our browser to locate the application name and version number without much difficulty.  

As we can see below the details for the application name and version are not hard to miss once we have loaded the website in our browser.

## üõ†Ô∏è TASK 3: CVE number that allows remote code exucution on this application?  
With the information we have gathered from question one and two in regards to the application name and version we can hope over to [Exploit-DB](https://www.exploit-db.com/) and search for FuelCMS. This will return us the below seven results, with six of them being related to version 1.4 and three beinf remote code execution explots.
