# Penetration Test Report    
**Engagement:** TryHackMe - Rabbit Store   
**Date:** October 2025

## Summary 
The engagement focused on the TryHackMe Rabbit Store room. During the test, three key web vulnerabilities were exploited to gain initial access: a Mass Assignment Vulnerability, Server-Side Request Forgery, and Server-Side Template Injection. Following initial access, the RabbitMQ service was enumerated to retrieve credentials and good root level access.  

Remediation recommendations include securing web application endpoints against Mass Assignment, Server-Side Request Forgery, and server-Side Template Injection vulnerabilities, by implementing strict input validation. Hardening of the RabbitMQ service is also recommended to prevent sensitive information being exposed.
