## 🧩 Challenge Task Overview  

**Objective:**  
This guide covers the steps required to solve all tasks in the Lookback room. The challenge involves web enumeration, command injection, and exploiting a vulnerable version of Microsoft Exchange. This room is marketed as an Active Directory room, but is just one machine running as a DC with many normal DC ports being blocked, making it a bit odd to work with. At the end of the guide, I breakdown some issues I was having getting a reverse shell due to encoding issues and the resolution.

## 🧰 Tools I Used

Firstly let’s start our target machine and give it a few minutes to start all relevant services. We can also either start the AttackBox or as in my case connect our own machine to the TryHackMe VPN.
